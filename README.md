# Code Laboratory

This is where I try out stuff and experiment with ideas.


## List of Stuff to Try Out
1. [**abi.encode**](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.26/cheatsheet.html#abi-encoding-and-decoding-functions): together with the whole family of related functions
   
2. [**call, staticcall, delegatecall**](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.26/types.html#members-of-addresses): the possibilities and implications, eg: contracts chain-calling each other, call-back contracts, reentrancy attack contracts
   
3. [**math and cryptography stuff**](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.26/cheatsheet.html#mathematical-and-cryptographic-functions): keccak256, sha256, and related functions
   
4. [**invariants and stateful fuzzing**](https://book.getfoundry.sh/forge/invariant-testing): code up **Invariants** and then figure out how to break them via **Stateful Fuzzing**


## abi.encode (and its family of related functions)

TBD.

## call, staticcall, delegatecall

Lotsa possibilities here. Implications are enormous. TBD.

## invariants and stateful fuzzing

Find a bunch of stuff and work through them. TBD.
