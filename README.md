# Code Laboratory

This is where I try out stuff and experiment with ideas.


## List of Stuff to Try Out
1. [**abi.encode**](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.26/cheatsheet.html#abi-encoding-and-decoding-functions): together with the whole family of related functions
   
2. [**call, staticcall, delegatecall**](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.26/types.html#members-of-addresses): the possibilities and implications, eg: contracts chain-calling each other, call-back contracts, reentrancy attack contracts
   
3. [**math and cryptography stuff**](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.26/cheatsheet.html#mathematical-and-cryptographic-functions): keccak256, sha256, and related functions


## abi.encode (and its family of related functions)

Sleepy. Will decide what exactly to play around with after some sleep.

## call, staticcall, delegatecall

Lotsa possibilities here. Implications are enormous. Will decide again after some sleep.
